# microMODDER
Small project for fun that aims to build upon MICROCRAFT and what it left us. The text below has been edited, so be sure to read it even if you're familiar with the original repository:

### MICROCRAFT
A Minicraft remake with some neat extras. Beat the fearsome **AIR WIZARD** to win the game!

<!-- TODO: update screenshot - ![screenshot](screen.png)-->

Some of the neat extras:
- Mithril (new material)
- Iron/Gold/Mithril armor
- Fancy lighting system
- Skeleton archers
- Blue and red slimes
- Cool new air wizard powers
- Character customization
- and much more...

## Running
See the [GitHub releases](https://github.com/jdah/microcraft/releases) page for pre-build versions.
Please note that this program requires Java JRE 16.

See below to build yourself and packaging for relases.
Any reasonable Java IDE can build the `.jar` file for this project and launch it through there.

## Building

- Mac: `$ ./package.sh` creates `Microcraft.exe`, which contains the application.
- Windows: `package.bat` creates `Microcraft.exe`, which contains the application.
- With any OS and a valid JDK 16+ install, both `package.{sh, bat}` create `out\artifacts\Microcraft\Microcraft.jar`. Both the `.jar` and executable can be run on their own.
